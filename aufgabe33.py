Write a Python program that will accept the base and height of a triangle and compute the area.

Python: Area of a triangle

A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices. It is one of the basic shapes in geometry. A triangle with vertices A, B, and C is denoted triangle ABC.

    Vertex of a triangle: The point at which two sides of a triangle meet.
    Altitude of a triangle: The perpendicular segment from a vertex of a triangle to the line containing the opposite side.
    Base of a triangle: The side of a triangle to which an altitude is drawn.
    Height of a triangle: The length of an altitude.



"""
b = int(input("Input the base : "))
h = int(input("Input the height : "))

area = b*h/2


print("area = ", area)
